She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
she takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

woah oh oh
Sweet child o' mine
woah oh oh oh
Sweet love of mine

(short guitar solo)

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by

woah oh oh
Sweet child o' mine
woah oh oh oh
Sweet love of mine

(short guitar solo)

woah oh oh oh 
Sweet child o' mine
woah oh oh
Sweet love of mine

woah oh oh oh 
Sweet child o' mine
woah oh oh
Sweet love of mine

guitar solo)

Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go

Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Sweet child o' mine
o Where do we go now
ah ah aiai ai ai 
Where do we go now
Where do we go 

Where do we go now
Where do we go now
where do we go
where do we go now
now now now now now now now
sweet child 
sweet child of mine
